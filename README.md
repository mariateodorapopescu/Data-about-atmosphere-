# Linked List Toolbox üß∞üîó

## Introduction
Welcome to the Linked List Toolbox, a collection of essential functions and operations on linked lists. This toolbox is designed to efficiently manage linked list data structures, providing a range of functionalities from simple node addition to advanced statistical analyses.

## Structure and Initialization
- **Creating the Structure:** The toolbox introduces a structure comprising links to the previous and next nodes, along with timestamp and value data fields.
- **Initialization:** Manual initiation involves allocating the first node and linking it to null for both previous and next nodes.

## Functions Overview
1. **Add Node:**
   - Appends values to the list, linking nodes appropriately.
   - Handles both an empty list and a populated one, traversing to insert nodes at the end.

2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - **2.1 Median Adjustment:**
      - Iterates over the list, adjusting for the median values according to a specified condition.
      - Deletes nodes where required, marked by a timestamp of -1.
   - **2.2 Median Replacement:**
      - Replaces original values with the median of sublists of five elements.
      - Implements sorting and insertion into the main list.
   - **2.3 Neighboring Averages:**
      - Averages values between neighboring nodes when the timestamp difference is between 100 and 1000.

   *(Note: Function 2.4 is pending successful implementation.)*

   - **2.5 Interval Analysis:**
      - Utilizes minimum and maximum functions to determine intervals with a count of elements in the list.
      - Displays the intervals and the number of elements within them.

## Initialization and Execution
- Allocates the head of the list and initializes it to null.
- Reads the number of nodes and corresponding elements from the keyboard.
- Executes functions based on provided arguments.
- Statistics are displayed unless specified otherwise.
- Releases allocated memory at the end.

## Conclusion
The Linked List Toolbox simplifies linked list management, offering versatile tools for manipulation and statistical analysis. Whether you're adding nodes or conducting complex evaluations, this toolbox ensures efficient handling of linked list data structures.
